- In Arduino IDE, search "esp32" in Library Manager and install the Espressif Systems package
- Go to Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino. Select AI Thinker ESP32-CAM board
- Go to Tools > Serial Monitor. Make sure the serial monitor speed is set to 115200 baud

## Code Load
- Replace "ssid" y "password" with your WiFi network (preferably not 5G)
- Verify the correct COM port is selected
